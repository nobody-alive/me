🎯 Goal of the Game

Start in Level 1.

Collect coins to increase your score.

Avoid spikes, enemies, and flying enemies — they take away health.

Pick up powerups to boost your abilities (like triple jump or dash).

Reach the right edge of the level (when your player’s x > 1500) to go to the next stage.

In Level 2, defeat or avoid the boss and reach the far right side again.

When you cross that point, the game shows “You Win!” — meaning you’ve completed all levels 🎉

❤️ Lose Condition

If your player’s health (3 hearts) drops to 0 →
👉 You go to the Game Over screen
Press Spacebar to restart from Level 1.
